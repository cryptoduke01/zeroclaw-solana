# Onca

Onca is a set of Solana tools for the [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw)
agent runtime. The tools let an agent handle money. They also keep the agent
safe while it does so.

## The name

Onca comes from *onça*, the Portuguese word for the jaguar. The jaguar is the
largest cat in the Americas and a common sight in Brazil. The name keeps the
claw of ZeroClaw and points it at Solana. We write the name as `Onca`, without
the cedilla, because a plain name is easy to type in a shell and a package. You
say the name as *ON-sah*.

## Why Onca exists

ZeroClaw is a self-hosted agent. It runs as one Rust binary on your own machine,
with your model and your keys. This design is the strength of ZeroClaw. It is
also the risk.

When an agent can move money, the model becomes a path to your wallet. The model
reads messages, mail, and web pages that you do not control. An attacker can
hide an instruction in that text. A private key behind a model is a hot wallet
with an attack surface.

Onca answers this risk directly. Each tool stays at the safe end of the custody
ladder. The agent makes a proposal. A person, a multisig, or a limited session
key approves it. A tool does one of two things: it reads the chain and reports,
or it builds an unsigned request for a person to sign. No tool in Onca holds a
key that can spend funds. The rules that keep this true live in plain Rust that
the model cannot change. [docs/custody.md](docs/custody.md) explains the ladder
and the threat model for the whole suite.

## The tools

| Component | Tier | Holds | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`onca-core`](crates/onca-core) | — | nothing | The shared Solana library: base58, pubkey, JSON-RPC, amount math. Pure Rust, no input or output. Every plugin uses it. |
| [`solana-pay-request`](plugins/solana-pay-request) | T1 | nothing | Turns a request such as "charge table 4 for 25 USDC" into a Solana Pay URL and QR code. A person signs it. |
| [`token-risk-check`](plugins/token-risk-check) | T0 | RPC key | Reads a mint and gives a red, amber, or green verdict: authorities, Token-2022 traps, and holder concentration. |
| [`payment-watch`](plugins/payment-watch) | T0 | RPC key | Watches a Solana Pay reference and confirms that an invoice was paid: the right amount, to the right wallet. |

Read the tiers this way. A T0 tool reads and reports. A T1 tool builds a request
that a person signs. Onca has no T2 tool. A T2 tool signs and sends. That tier
is where one successful attack empties a wallet, and no tool here needs it.

The three plugins make one story. `solana-pay-request` asks for money.
`payment-watch` confirms that the money arrived. `token-risk-check` stops the
agent before it touches a bad token. All three use `onca-core`.

## The core

`solana-sdk` and `solana-client` are the usual way to use Solana from Rust.
Neither one builds cleanly for `wasm32-wasip2` inside a WIT component. Both need
sockets, threads, and a full operating system. A sandboxed plugin does not have
these. To solve the problem one time, the Solana code lives in one place:
[`onca-core`](crates/onca-core).

The core is a plain library. It has no wasm dependency and it does no input or
output. It parses an address, builds a JSON-RPC request, reads the response, and
converts base units to human amounts. The one thing it does not do is make the
HTTP call. A trait does that:

```rust
pub trait RpcTransport {
    fn post_json(&self, url: &str, body: &str) -> onca_core::Result<String>;
}
```

Each plugin gives the trait a real client. On wasm, the plugin uses the
[`waki`](https://crates.io/crates/waki) client, and the host does TLS. The tests
give the trait a mock. Because the trait is the only seam, the full RPC layer
runs under `cargo test` on the host with no network. The tests check behavior,
not only text. [docs/wasm-notes.md](docs/wasm-notes.md) records what was hard
about `wasm32-wasip2`.

## The shape of each plugin

Every plugin uses the same split. The bounty requires it, and it is also the
correct design:

```
src/<logic>.rs   pure Rust. All checks and policy. No wasm. The host tests it.
src/lib.rs       a thin wasm shim. It connects the logic to the tool-plugin world.
tests/           host tests over the pure core. The RPC is a mock.
manifest.toml    name, version, capabilities, and the fewest permissions that work.
README.md        what the tool does, its config, its custody tier, its threat model.
```

The split has a purpose beyond order. The rules that limit the tool, such as a
spend cap, a mint allowlist, and address checks, live in the pure core. They run
on every call. The model never sees the config that limits it, and it cannot
turn the config off. To pass a rule, you would have to change the code and build
the component again. At that point you are the operator, not the attacker.

## Build and test

You can test everything on the host. You do not need a wasm toolchain or a
network:

```bash
cd crates/onca-core           && cargo test
cd plugins/solana-pay-request && cargo test
cd plugins/token-risk-check   && cargo test
cd plugins/payment-watch      && cargo test
```

To build one component:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cd plugins/solana-pay-request
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
```

[docs/install.md](docs/install.md) is the full guide for an operator.

## Status

The core and all three plugins are complete. Each plugin has a pure core, a wasm
component that builds clean, host tests with a fail-closed prompt-injection
case, a manifest with the fewest permissions, and a README with a threat model.
The suite has 47 host tests.

Two items remain. The first is a short demo of a live ZeroClaw agent on Telegram
that runs the full loop. The second is a stretch goal: versioned-transaction and
durable-nonce support in `onca-core`, so the suite can add a signed-transfer
builder and keep the same custody rules.
